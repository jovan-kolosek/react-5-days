Congratulations for coming to the end of this tutorial!

Today, you won't get a task that's strictly defined as before.
Portals, Fragments and Context are relatively new in React, and
not so widely used yet. However, as React plans to be completely
independent in terms of handling application state soon, meaning
that there won't be a need for libraries like Redux, it's good to
get to know and understand these three concepts, as those are going
to be the key to new state handling.


This doesn't mean that you don't have a task for today: quite the opposite,
your task today, after finishing the reading of materials, is to think of
some of the use cases for these three, and implement whatever you think is
a good use case.
In case you can't think of anything better, redo the task from day 2 and use
these to help you write better code than the one you wrote couple of days ago!

Of course, you have to cover those with tests as well!

*Examples for DOM testing are in jest documentation, make sure to write DOM tests as well!*
